## What you should see:

1. The default counter begins at the number 0.
2. When you click “Lower Count”, the counter should decrement by 1. If the count goes below 0, the number should change to the color red.
3. When you click “Add Count”, the counter should increment by 1. If the count goes above 0, the number should change to the color green.
